<p>The goal is to set up my development environment to be lite-weight, and easy to re-create from a fresh install.  Why?  Because I do most of my development in Ubuntu, which is running in a Virtualbox VM on my crappy Windows work laptop.  The laptop has 4GB of memory and a low-end dual-core CPU with hyperthreading, so 4 virtual cores.  In the past I just worked directly in the ubuntu VM, depending on Github to save my work from oblivion in the event that the VM became corrupt (happens much less these days, I’m happy to report, but the scars are burned deep into my brain) or the IT department decides to reinstall windows because the printer driver stops working. If this happened, I had several hours of quality time with google and the command line ahead of me before I was productive again. Furthermore because my ‘play time’ is limitted, this was usually spread out over several days.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pro Tip: If you really want to make your wife angry, try sitting next to her on the couch while watching TV after the kids have goine to bed and completey ignore her while you google websites with an oddly large amount of text and do weird things on the command line (!!) that generate massive amounts of unreadable text output.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My solution to this puzzle is to run Docker containers for each of my projects.  This was I don’t overload the Ubuntu VM with multiple databases, multiple versions of Ruby, etc.  Added benefits are that I can upload the Containers to Docker and then use them on my home PC, or next ubuntu VM. Extra added benefits are that I don’t need to have so many apps and libraries directly loaded onto the base Ubuntu system, whick makes reinstalling everything easier. In fact I automated that part with Thoughbot’s <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop">Laptop</a> library.  In this post, I want to explain how I set up my Docker containers for developing a Golang project using the <a href="http://revel.github.io/">Revel</a> framework.</p>

<h2 id="lets-go">Let’s Go!</h2>

<p>The folks working on Go have been very busy lately and new versions seem to be coming out every few months.  If I start a new project, I definately want to go with the latest version, but I don’t want to be forced to switch in mid-project.  With Docker, this is no problem.  Just put Go in the Docker container for that project.  New projects will get the latest version, but older projects can stay on their version with no conflict.  Upgrading Go versions is also significantly less risky.  Just edit the docker file to use the newer version and try it. If it blows up, just revert to the previous versoin and rebuild the container and boom! - I’ll be right back in the happy place with everything working.  The same principle applies to the Go libraries that I will use (which are often unversioned…).  This means tĥat the Go base libraries and any additional libraries I use should be in Docker, but what about the source code for my project?  I don’t want this in Docker, because I want to edit in my Ubuntu VM, but I don’t have Go installed in Ubuntu so I can’t build anything or use the Go Tools. The answer is only mildly complicated. Create a volume in the Docker container that maps the base directory for my project’s source code to the same location (relative to the GOPATH) in the Container. With this setup, every time I save a Go file in my editor it is immeadiately updated in the Container. The same works in reverse. If I run Go’s formatter, I whave to do it in Docker, but the files in the base Ubuntu VM will be changed. Perfect, that’s exactly what I am looking for.  The downside is that I have to use <code>Docker run</code> to run these commands in the Container, which would be quit boring, but fortunately there are some pretty good solutions.</p>

<p>Here is  my Docker file:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">FROM ubuntu:14.04
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y build-essential mercurial git subversion wget curl

# env vars

ENV GOPATH /goprojects
ENV PATH /goprojects/bin:/usr/local/go/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games

# go 1.3 tarball
RUN wget -qO- http://golang.org/dl/go1.3.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar -C /usr/local -xzf -

# GOPATH
RUN mkdir -p /goprojects
RUN mkdir -p /goprojects/bin
RUN mkdir -p /goprojects/pkg
RUN mkdir -p /goprojects/src
RUN mkdir -p /goprojects/src/github.com
RUN mkdir -p /goprojects/src/github.com/jmedding  # I will attach my source code volume here

#Install Revel framework
RUN go get github.com/revel/revel
RUN go get github.com/revel/cmd/revel

WORKDIR /goprojects/src/github.com/jmedding</code></pre></div>

<p>I install the Revel framework in the Dockerfile, in fact when ever you add a new package to your source code, you should install it via the Dockerfile as well.  Go will get imported packages for you when you build your project, but it will be lost when you stop the container and it will have to be retrieved again when you spin the Container back up.</p>

<h2 id="fig-up-to-the-rescue">Fig up to the rescue</h2>

<p>I mentioned earlier that setting up and working in the Docker container will require some command line gymnastics - not my favorite stuff. That’s where Fig comes in.  Fig is a simple tool that automates starting up and configuring all of a projects containers.  Fig also provides a simple command line interface to execute commands in the Container when needed.  After installing Fig locally the next step is to set up the fig.yml file, which Fig uses to spin up the Docker Containers. Oh, by the way, Fig was recently aquired by Docker, so it should continue to maintained in the future.  Here is my fig.yml</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">web:
  build: .
  volumes:
    - /home/jon/goprojects/src/github.com/jmedding:/goprojects/src/github.com/jmedding
  ports:
    - &quot;9000:9000&quot;
  #command: revel run github.com/jmedding/my_revel_project dev</code></pre></div>

<ul>
  <li>This fig.yml file will create one container -‘web’, for my Revel project.</li>
  <li>The build command will look in the current working directory for the Dockerfile, which is a temprory project folder in my local GOPATH 
<code>$GOPATH/src/github.com/jmedding/temp_project</code></li>
  <li>Fig will set up the volume to my source code</li>
  <li>Expose the Container’s port 9000 as port 9000 on the host.</li>
  <li>The command directive, that will start my project in the devlopment environment is commented out, because I haven’t created the project yet</li>
</ul>

<p>Next run <code>fig build</code> and then <code>fig up</code> to start the container, which has Go installed and the required Go directory structure set up in the GOPATH.</p>

<h2 id="revelation">Revelation</h2>
<p>We are now ready to start developing in ernest.  The first step is to use Revel’s CLI tools to generate a new project.  We want the source code on the local file system, but we don’t have Go installed locally (or Revel for that matter), only in the Container.  It’s time to break out Fig’s <code>run</code> command.</p>

<p>Run the following from the temporary project directory that contains your fig.yml and Dockerfile files:
<code>fig run web revel new github.com/jmedding/my_revel_project</code></p>

<p>Fig will run the <code>revel new github.com/jmedding/my_revel_project</code> command in the Container designated as ‘web’ in fig.yml.  The file path/name used in the Revel’s <code>new</code> command is always relative to the GOPATH so you have to include the necessary sub-directories to ensure the project is created in the right location.  At this point your should be able to point your browser to localhost:9000 and see the default web page being showed.  Before starting to create the next Facetwoogle there are a few more tasks to do though.  First, move the fig.yml and the Dockerfile into you new project’s root directory.  At this point, you can delete the temporary project directory - you don’t need it any more for this project. Finally, create a new git Repo and make your first commit and then off you go.</p>

<p>In my next post, I’ll show how to create a new Container for Postgres and wire it up to your application.</p>

<p>Code on.</p>
