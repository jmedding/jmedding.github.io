  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Well, it’s been a while.  I decided that Go wasn’t my cup of tea. It seemed like I was working to hard to get some things done that felt like they should have been easier.  I guess my comfort zone is in the higher-level languages.  But I’m still attracted to efficient and performant solutions, which Ruby is not.  Lately, I have been working with Elixir and Elm.  Elixir is very nice. OTP just makes sense, although my brain is still trying to grok the medium and high complexity design paterns.  Elm is weird. It’s very different than other languages that I have worked with, but when  it clicks, it clicks although some times that takes a lot of thinking and struggling. One recent example of this has been handling mouse events.  I want to highlight an  SVG element when the mouse is over it and be able to drag it around.  In this post, I will try explain some of the things that I struggled with so that I don’t forget it all and that maybe others can save a few days on their Elm journey as well.</p>

<h2 id="htmlevents-for-the-mouse">Html.Events for the Mouse</h2>

<p>The Elm Architecture tutorial jumps right into mouse interactions with it’s <a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/user_input/buttons.html">button</a> tutorial.  Here, the Html.Events package allows us to catch mouse events related to HTML nodes.</p>

<p>button.elm:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">-- VIEW

view : Model -&gt; Html Msg
view model =
  div []
    [ button [ Html.Events.onClick Decrement ] [ text &quot;-&quot; ]
    , div [] [ text (toString model) ]
    ]</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>Html.Events.onClick</code> function takes a Msg as an input and produces an <code>Html.Attribute Msg</code>, satisfying the type requirements for an Html node’s first list argument.  In this case, <code>onClick</code>’s <code>Msg</code> is <code>Decrement</code>.  So when the button is clicked, the update function receives the <code>Decrement</code> message.  Here is the whole code, including an increment button:</p>

<p>button.elm:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">import Html exposing (Html, button, div, text)
import Html.Events exposing (onClick)


main =
  Html.beginnerProgram { model = model, view = view, update = update }


-- MODEL

type alias Model = Int

model : Model
model =
  0


-- UPDATE

type Msg = Decrement

update : Msg -&gt; Model -&gt; Model
update msg model =
  case msg of
    Increment -&gt;
      model + 1

    Decrement -&gt;
      model - 1


-- VIEW

view : Model -&gt; Html Msg
view model =
  div []
    [ button [ onClick Decrement ] [ text &quot;-&quot; ]
    , div [] [ text (toString model) ]
    , button [ onClick Increment ] [ text &quot;+&quot; ]
    ]</code></pre></div>

<p>Using the <code>Html.Events</code>’s mouse event handlers is the simplest way to work with mouse events.  It covers a lot of use cases but does have some limitations, mainly that there is no additional information passed to the <code>update</code> function when the object is clicked.  We just know that something was clicked, nothing more.  That means that the everything has to be hard-coded. Each unique button needs a unique message, which must be specifically handled in the <code>update</code> function. If we want to DRY up our code or catch mouse events from dynamically generated HTML elements then we need something else.</p>

<h2 id="htmlevents-with-data">Html.Events with data</h2>

<p>Let’s use the same program as before, but make it a bit more DRY. In this case, instead of having unique <code>Increment</code> and <code>Decrement</code> messages, we will define only a <code>Change</code> message and tag it with an <code>Int</code> value.  Now when we use <code>onClick</code> we can use a message like <code>Change 2</code> to increment by 2 or <code>Change -1</code> to decrement by 1.  Here is the code:</p>

<p>mouse_with_data.elm:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">import Html exposing (Html, button, div, text)
import Html.Events exposing (onClick)


main =
  Html.beginnerProgram { model = model, view = view, update = update }


-- MODEL

type alias Model = Int

model : Model
model =
  0


-- UPDATE

type Msg = Change Int

update : Msg -&gt; Model -&gt; Model
update msg model =
  case msg of
    Change amount -&gt;
      model + 1 * amount

-- VIEW

view : Model -&gt; Html Msg
view model =
  div []
    [ button [ onClick (Change -1) ] [ text &quot;-&quot; ]
    , div [] [ text (toString model) ]
    , button [ onClick (Change 2) ] [ text &quot;+&quot; ]
    ]</code></pre></div>

<p>Now we just need to handle a single <code>Msg</code>.  One note is that we had to wrap the who message in parentheses so that it appears as a single element to the <code>onClick</code> function.  This is the classic Elm Architecture at work.  We click on something, it fires off a <code>Msg</code>, which is passed to our <code>update</code> function, which is where we can change the model, which is then passed to the view, which updates the DOM.  Recognizing this pattern and understanding it is the key to Elm.  Since we can define our own <code>Msg</code> types, we can theoretically pass any data that is available, at the time of the event to the <code>update</code> function.</p>

<h2 id="htmlevents-with-dom-event-data">HTML.Events with DOM event data</h2>

<p>In many instances, it would be interesting to pass some of the mouse event information to our <code>update</code> function. Let’s look at the source code for <code>Html.Events.onClick</code> to see what is going on, under the hood.</p>

<p>Html/Events.elm:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">import Html exposing (Attribute)
import Json.Decode as Json
import VirtualDom

onClick : msg -&gt; Attribute msg
onClick msg =
on &quot;click&quot; (Json.succeed msg)

on : String -&gt; Json.Decoder msg -&gt; Attribute msg
on =
VirtualDom.on</code></pre></div>

<p>We see that <code>Html.Events.onClick</code> is calling the <code>on</code> function, which takes a string that represents the event name in Javascript’s <code>addEventListener</code> function and a <code>Json.Decoder</code> tagged with a <code>msg</code> as the second argument.  The <code>onClick</code> function passes the String “click” and the <code>Json.Decoder.succeed</code> function tagged with the <code>msg</code> that we passed to <code>onClick</code>.  The <code>Json.Decoder.succeed</code> function doesn’t actually decode anything.  It simply “succeeds” without parsing anything that was submitted to the decoder, finally emitting the <code>msg</code> that was given as the argument.  We can see from this, that we will never get any of the typical Javascript <code>event</code> data by using onClick.</p>

<p>If we want to pass any data from the DOM <code>click</code> event to our update function we will have to use the <code>Html.Events.on</code> function directly.  This is more complicated than just using <code>Html.Events.onClick</code> but it should be manageable if we can break it down.  The <code>VirtualDom.on</code> function will send the DOM event data to the Json.Decoder that we gave it.  We need to (1) create a decoder that will extract the bit that we need and (2) define a message that can be tagged with that data and finally (3) tag the message wit the decoded data.  In the example below, we extract the event target’s ID and attach it to the <code>Click</code> message.  Remember, <code>Click</code> is a constructor function for the <code>Click String</code> message, so calling <code>Click "me"</code> will create a <code>Msg</code> of type <code>Click</code> that is tagged with the String <code>"me"</code>.</p>

<p>mouse_event_payload_data.elm:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">import Html exposing (Html, button, div, text)
import Html.Attributes exposing ( id )
import Html.Events
import Json.Decode


main =
  Html.beginnerProgram { model = model, view = view, update = update }


-- MODEL

type alias Model = String

model : Model
model =
  &quot;empty&quot;


-- UPDATE

type Msg = Click String

update : Msg -&gt; Model -&gt; Model
update msg model =
  case msg of
    Click value -&gt;
      value ++ &quot; clicked&quot;

-- VIEW

view : Model -&gt; Html Msg
view model =
  div []
    [ button [ id &quot;A&quot;, customOnClick ] [ text &quot;A&quot; ]
    , div [] [ text (toString model) ]
    , button [ id &quot;B&quot;, customOnClick ] [ text &quot;B&quot; ]
    ]

customOnClick : Html.Attribute Msg
customOnClick =
  let
    
    decoder = Json.Decode.map Click (Json.Decode.at [&quot;target&quot;, &quot;id&quot;] Json.Decode.string) -- String -&gt; Msg
      
  in
      
    Html.Events.on &quot;click&quot; decoder</code></pre></div>

<p>One gotcha that you might face is when the decoder fails to successfully parse the event’s json value. When this happens, the process dies silently and it appears as if the click was not handled. There is no sign that anything changed because of the click or even an error in the browser’s console. For instance, if I had used the following:</p>

<p>mouse_event_payload_data.elm:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">customOnClick : Html.Attribute Msg
customOnClick =
  let
    
    decoder = Json.Decode.map Click (Json.Decode.at [&quot;target&quot;, &quot;does_not_exist&quot;] Json.Decode.string) -- String -&gt; Msg
      
  in
      
    Html.Events.on &quot;click&quot; decoder</code></pre></div>

<p>clicking on the buttons would have no effect.  One way to avoid this is to expand the decoder so that it sends a helpful message incase the json was not able to be parsed.</p>

<p>mouse_event_payload_data.elm:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">customOnClick : Html.Attribute Msg
customOnClick =
  let
    
    decoder = 
      Json.Decode.oneOf
      [ Json.Decode.map Click (Json.Decode.at [&quot;target&quot;, &quot;idd&quot;] Json.Decode.string) -- String -&gt; Msg
      , Json.Decode.succeed (Click &quot;Failed&quot;)
      ] 
      
  in
      
    Html.Events.on &quot;click&quot; decoder</code></pre></div>

<p>In this case, if the first decoder in the list fails, then the second one will always succeed issuing the <code>Click "Failed"</code> message.  If you aren’t sure ŵhat information is available in the Event’s json payload, you can use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector/How_to/Examine_event_listeners">this event viewer</a> in the browser’s Inspector to set a breakpoint in the event handler and then view the actual event object in the browser’s console.  This is extremely useful if you are not intimately familiar with the event objects.</p>

<h2 id="making-it-work-with-svg">Making it work with SVG</h2>

<p>Elm has an <code>Svg.Events</code> module very similar to <code>Html.Events</code>. Here it is in action.</p>

<p>mouse_and_svg.elm:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">import Html exposing (Html, button, div, text)
import Html.Events
import Json.Decode
import Svg exposing (svg, rect)
import Svg.Attributes exposing (..)

main =
  Html.beginnerProgram { model = model, view = view, update = update }


-- MODEL

type alias Model = String

model : Model
model =
  &quot;empty&quot;


-- UPDATE

type Msg = Click String

update : Msg -&gt; Model -&gt; Model
update msg model =
  case msg of
    Click value -&gt;
      value ++ &quot; clicked&quot;

-- VIEW

view : Model -&gt; Html Msg
view model =
  div []
    [ svg
        [ width &quot;400&quot;
        , height &quot;100&quot;
        , viewBox &quot;0 0 400 100&quot;
        ]
        [ rect
            [ customOnClick 
            , id &quot;C&quot;
            , width &quot;100&quot;
            , height &quot;050&quot;
            , x &quot;0&quot;
            , y &quot;0&quot;
            , fill &quot;#000&quot;
            , cursor &quot;pointer&quot;
            ]
            []
        ]
      , div [] [ text model ]
    ]

customOnClick : Html.Attribute Msg
customOnClick =
  let
    
    decoder = 
      Json.Decode.oneOf
      [ Json.Decode.map Click (Json.Decode.at [&quot;target&quot;, &quot;id&quot;] Json.Decode.string) -- String -&gt; Msg
      , Json.Decode.succeed (Click &quot;Failed&quot;)
      ]  
      
  in
      
    Html.Events.on &quot;click&quot; decoder</code></pre></div>

<p>This is very similar to handling Html. In fact, SVG.Events.on also calls VirtualDom.on, so the two can be used interchangeably. One thing to remember is that the data in the click event for SVG nodes can be different than those for Html, so be sure to verify the event objects when things do not work as expected.</p>

<h2 id="when-all-else-fails-the-elm-langmouse-module">When all else fails, the Elm-lang/Mouse module</h2>
<p>Elm also offers the <code>Mouse</code> module, which lets you subscribe to mouse <code>clicks</code>, <code>ups</code>, <code>downs</code> and <code>moves</code>.  We need this module to make our SVG element draggable because there is no way to detect mouse movement after the <code>mousedown</code> event using just <code>Svg.Events</code>.  In the code below I have extended the model  to include a <code>Position</code> and a <code>Maybe Drag</code>. Initially, <code>model.drag</code> is <code>Nothing</code>, but when you click on the SVG Rectangle, it’s <code>customOnMouseDown</code> listener will cause a <code>Press</code> message tagged with the current mouse position to be sent to the <code>update</code> function, which will then create a <code>Drag</code> object and add it to the model. Once the model actually has a <code>Drag</code>, this will trigger two subscriptions. One for <code>Mouse.moves</code> and one for <code>Mouse.ups</code>.  <code>Mouse.moves</code> will update the <code>currentPos</code> attribute of  <code>model.drag</code>, which is used to offset the location of the Rectangle in the <code>view</code> function.  When the <code>Mouse.ups</code> event occurs, a <code>Release</code> message is sent to <code>update</code>, where the <code>model.position</code> is updated to reflect the mouse move and <code>model.drag</code> is set to <code>Nothing</code>, which has the effect of removing the two mouse subscriptions.  It is a good practive to only subscribe to <code>Mouse.moves</code> when needed, otherwise you will have to handle a lot of events for no gain, potential impacting app performance.</p>

<p>This last example was fairly involved.  On one hand, I’m sure that there are some more ‘elmy’ ways to implement this code, so feedback is definately welcome. On the otherhand, It’s still very basic in some ways. For instance, it is possible to drag the object outside of the viewable area of the SVG node. If you do that and release the mouse you won’t be able to grab it again, so this should be prevented.  For my current project, I will need to manage several draggable SVG elements, but after digging in and learning enough about mouse events in Elm to write this post, I think I will be able to manage it.</p>
